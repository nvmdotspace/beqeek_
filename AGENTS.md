<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->

# OpenSpec Instructions

- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding
- **UI/UX Changes**: Any frontend development, component creation, or styling work
- **Design Work**: Layout changes, responsive design, or visual improvements
- Project structure and guidelines
- **Design System Requirements**: Mandatory UI/UX development standards
- **Component Development**: Workflow and best practices for frontend development

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `apps/web` is a Vite + React SPA that uses the TanStack suite (Router, Query, Form) and Tailwind CSS utilities from `@workspace/ui`. Route components live in `src/routes`, shared providers in `src/providers`, global state in `src/stores`, and feature code should colocate with routes when practical.
- `packages/ui` exposes reusable React components (`src/components/**`) and Tailwind styles. Update the barrel exports in `packages/ui/src/index.ts` when adding new primitives.
- `packages/eslint-config` and `packages/typescript-config` provide shared lint/TS baselines; extend these rather than duplicating rules per app.
- `turbo.json` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` define task pipelines and workspace membership; update both when adding a new package or app.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `pnpm install` hydrates all workspace dependencies using the Node 22 toolchain declared in `package.json`.
- `pnpm dev` runs `turbo dev`, which triggers `pnpm --filter web dev` (Vite dev server). Prefer `pnpm --filter web dev -- --host 127.0.0.1` when binding needs to be explicit.
- `pnpm build` runs `turbo build`, which calls `vite build` in `apps/web` and any package-level build scripts.
- `pnpm lint` executes `turbo lint`; each package should expose a local `lint` script using the shared ESLint config.
- Type-checks run via `pnpm --filter web run check-types` until a unified `check-types` pipeline is in place.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- TypeScript is required; keep strict options aligned with `packages/typescript-config`.
- Prettier (root `format` script) enforces two-space indentation and double-quoted JSX props; run `pnpm format` for bulk updates.
- Follow React conventions: components in PascalCase (`Button.tsx`), hooks in camelCase starting with `use`, and directories in lowercase-hyphen (`form-fields`).
- Re-export UI primitives from `packages/ui/src/index.ts` so consumers keep a single import surface.
- Use TanStack libraries for routing/data/forms;

## Design System Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **Design System Compliance**: All UI changes MUST follow `docs/design-system.md`
- **Component Reuse**: Always check `@workspace/ui` before creating new components
- **Styling Standards**: Use CSS custom properties defined in design system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with defined breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required for all new features
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing required for all components and props
- **Vietnamese Support**: Typography and spacing optimized for Vietnamese content

### Component Development Workflow

1. **Check Existing**: Search `packages/ui/` for similar components first
2. **Follow Patterns**: Use existing component structure and naming
3. **Design Tokens**: Use CSS custom properties from design system
4. **Responsive**: Implement mobile-first with defined breakpoints
5. **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### Styling Requirements

- **Colors**: Use semantic color variables from design system
- **Spacing**: Follow 8px base unit spacing scale
- **Typography**: Use defined font stacks and type scale
- **Animations**: Use defined transition presets and easing functions
- **Dark Mode**: Support both light and dark themes

### Design System Validation

```bash
# Check design system compliance
rg -n "bg-|text-|border-" src/ --type tsx  # Verify using design tokens
rg -n "className=" src/ --type tsx        # Check Tailwind usage
rg -n "interface.*Props" src/ --type tsx   # Verify TypeScript interfaces
```

## Global State Rules

- Zustand is the approved global state solution. Create stores under `apps/web/src/stores`, export typed hooks (e.g. `useAppStore`), and keep server state in React Queryâ€”not in Zustand.
- When adding new shared state, document the shape and usage inside the relevant store file and ensure components subscribe using selector functions to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

## Testing Guidelines

- A dedicated test runner is not yet configured; when introducing one (Vitest + Testing Library recommended), add a `test` script per package and register it in `turbo.json`.
- Co-locate tests as `*.test.tsx` or group them under `__tests__/` to leverage Vite module resolution.
- Until automated tests exist, rely on `pnpm lint` plus manual verification in `pnpm --filter web dev`; document any new coverage expectations in PR descriptions.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Follow the existing Git history: short, imperative commit subjects with a scoped prefix when helpful (`chore:`, `fix:`, etc.); emojis are optional but used sparingly.
- Each PR should describe the change, note affected packages, and link issues or tasks. Screenshots/GIFs are expected for UI tweaks in `apps/web`.
- Ensure lint/build pipelines succeed locally (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`) before opening a PR, and mention any skipped checks with justification.
- **Design System Review**: All UI changes must be validated against `docs/design-system.md` before PR submission
- **Component Verification**: Ensure new components follow established patterns and TypeScript interfaces
